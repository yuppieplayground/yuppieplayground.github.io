I ate your messages the other day. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to. 
<br>
It was an accident, really. 
<br>
<br>
I woke up in the middle of the night to that hum and it was the first thing I saw on the bedside table.  Course it's not like i meant to so quickly...I wonder if I had been at the dining table (as I normally am with these types of things), fork and knife and spoon in hand, dissecting the spaces between words and stabbing each one by one I would have--
<br><br>
My doctors tell me I have high cholesterol and that I need to curb the eggs and butter, especially at night. That over time, I will have plaque buildups in my coronary arteries. It will HARDEN, they say. Eventually, they will close up and no more blood will pump through them. 
<br><br>
The thing I have forgotten to tell them is i'm actually  <br> a taxidermist! I'll stuff my insides silly with the air from the space you gave me. 
<br><br>
So again, I hope you can see that it was all just a careless mistake. I'll be better next time :)
</p>
